\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Buddy program:} At least 2-3 PhD students will accompany a new student (purely voluntarily)
    \item \textbf{Informal Group Discussion:} I don't know how many research group are there but one group will be selected at random (I meant by lottery) per week and all the group members jointly or individually discuss their researches in general and all the PhD students will be there to learn, discuss and joke about it. This position is meant to be to maintain a social environment apart from work for the doctoral students and studying and learning is the primary common ground among us. So, I think, everybody will be happy to discuss their researches.
    \item \textbf{A common virtual office environment.}
    \item \textbf{Attaching the support and HR with our sessions,} where they will answer our queries regarding issues or they can individually lecture us on different relevant matters.
